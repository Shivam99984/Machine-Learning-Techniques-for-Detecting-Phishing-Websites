- Click on the **New Application** button.
- Fill out the application form:
  - **Application Name**: Name your app.
  - **Description**: Describe what your app does.
- Click **Create Application**.

### 3. Obtain Access Key and Secret Key
- After creating your application, you will see your **Access Key** and **Secret Key**. Use the Access Key to authenticate your requests.
- Keep your Secret Key confidential.

### 4. Read the API Documentation
- Familiarize yourself with the [Unsplash API documentation](https://unsplash.com/documentation) for available endpoints, request methods, and usage guidelines.

### 5. Make API Requests
- Use the Access Key to make API requests. Hereâ€™s an example in Python using the `requests` library( Use in `features24.html` , `features25.html` ):
```
In HTML(features25,features24)

const apiKey = 'use your api key';
